# Fulton Schools Divi Theme #

A child theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) in use by various publications from the [Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering](http://engineering.asu.edu) at [Arizona State University](http://asu.edu). 

The theme has several enhancements that make it specific to the Fulton Schools of Engineering. It has been made public in the hopes that other organizations within ASU will benefit from the work as WordPress adoption on campus continues to increase.

## Requirements ##

The parent theme for the FSDT is the excellent [Divi Theme from Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/). If you intend to use the theme to build your own WordPress site, a separate license for the Divi Theme is necessary. 

Please also note that this repository contains a child theme and not a stand-alone theme designed for use with [The Divi Builder](http://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/divi-builder/) plugin also from Elegant Themes.

## Enhancements ##

#### Version 1.9.0 (Iago) ####
This version of the FSDT begins with a refactoring of the global ASU Header and Footer elements to conform more closely with the code choices made in the [ASU Divi theme](https://github.com/asuengineering/asu-divi). This is also an official recognition of [ASU Divi](https://github.com/asuengineering/asu-divi) as an eventual replacement for this product. A sunset plan is forthcoming.

* Refactored CSS and included styles to directly call ASU header and footer elements from the original UTO repository.
* Footer elements updated to include the 2019 Innovation badge.

-- *Iago, Othello (1503-1504)*

#### Version 1.8.6 ####

* Updates global header and footer assets.
* Addresses accessibility concerns for parent theme regarding :focus definition.

#### Version 1.8.5 ####

* Addresses several automatically generated broken links to RSS feeds which may no exist under normal circumstances.
* Decommissions outdated theme options pages and widgets.

#### Version 1.8.4 ####

* Minor CSS fixes, added utility class for sidebar creation. 

#### Version 1.8.3 ####

* Included new assets for ASU Brand Standards, including fixes to the global header, footer and endorsed logo. 
* Added Snapchat to the ASU Social Medial Icons Footer Widget

#### Version 1.8.2 ####

* Bug fix for new footer widgets. Contribute URL's now appear as expected. (Previously defaulted to current site home page.)
* Version number incorrectly reported with last major release. Skipped ahead to 1.8.2 for GitHub Updater to work properly.

#### Version 1.8 (Balthasar) ####

Two new widgets for the super-footer were created with this release to accommodate the new Fulton Schools of Engineering logo and more closely conform to [ASU Brand Guide](https://brandguide.asu.edu/web-standards/enterprise/super-footer) standards.

* The new **ASU Engineering Footer Widget** automatically includes the new FSE endorsed logo, complete with link to the Engineering home page. No need to add it to the media library.
* The new **ASU Social Media Icons Footer Widget** centralizes the location of all URL entries for social media channels to one widget.

This release also depreciates two older widgets from an older FSDT release. See wp-admin/admin.php?page=asu_social_media_editor and wp-admin/admin.php?page=asu_social_media_editor within your install for more details.

Further improvements also include:

* Proper handling/styling of linked images and external links. 
* Improvements to the Divi Portfolio module to align the filter bar and other module elements to ASU Brand Standards.

#### Version 1.7 (Portia) ####

* Changes to Mega Menu formatting now includes a column header format for each column of links within the menu.
* Introduced new experimental "compact" formatting for sidebar elements. Reduces padding/elements within sidebars build within Divi. Adds differentiation among H3/H4/H5 elements used as headers within.
* Introduced GitHub Issue Tracking as a way to keep track of future enhancements. [Feedback always welcome](https://github.com/fsoe-asu/fultonSchoolsDiviTheme/issues).
* Nifty new documentation and version naming.
* Enables updates to the theme via [GihHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin.

#### Version 1.6 (Costard) ####

Version 1.6 focused on the proper implementation of ASU Global Header and Footer assets. All assets are included with the the theme, and we continue to watch the ASU Web Standards page (and eventual repo) for changes and apply them as needed.

Much credit given to the (Global Institute of Sustainability)[https://github.com/gios-asu] and the associated authors of the [ASU Web Standards WordPress Theme](https://github.com/gios-asu/ASU-Web-Standards-Wordpress-Theme), from which most of the code for this release was borrowed.

let me borrow my arms again."
